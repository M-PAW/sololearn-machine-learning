# There are two different types of learning

 1. Supervised learning, which is when we have a known target based on past data.
 2. Unsupervised learning, when we have no past data to use for evaluation.


 ## We will focus primarily on Supervised Learning, which include two problem types
  1. Classification - predicting what class something belongs to.
    - Such as if a borrower will default on a loan.
  2. Regression - predicting a numerical value.


## We will primarily use four popular techniques to solve these problems.
 1. Logical Regression
 2. Decision Tree
 3. Random Forests
 4. Neural Networks


## There are a few common formulas that we will use
 1. Mean and Medium
 2. Percentiles
 3. Standard Devation & Variance
    - Variance - add all of the numbers together and then divide the      
      total count of numbers to find the mean. Then subtract each number in the set
      from the mean to find the disances of each number. The take the above numeber and square each, add them together, and divide by the total numbers in the set. This will be your variance.
    - Standard Deviation - Take the square root of the variance, and that is our 
      standard deviation. This is commonly represented with a bell curve.
